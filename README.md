Chess game personal project:
A chess game that allows all the basic functionality of a real chess game, including more complex moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn auto-promoting to queens.
I would have liked to add choice-based promoting, but I envisioned it in a way that would require an overlay that presents the player with the options, and that seemed like a lot of work and I kind of grew tired of it.
The project also includes a makefile that makes it easier to run.

TERMINAL COMMANDS: 
build:               'make build'
build with debug:    'make debug'
run:                 'make run'
clean:               'make clean'
rebuild:             'make rebuild'
